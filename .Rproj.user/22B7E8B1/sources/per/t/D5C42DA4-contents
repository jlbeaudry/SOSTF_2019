#CONVERT TO A FACTOR
#convert the crisis variable to a FACTOR (fct). THIS WORKS, BUT I DON'T NEED IT.
#plus I'm also going to change the names of the levels
#df$crisis <- factor(df$crisis)
#str(df$crisis) #test to make sure it's reading it as a factor
df$crisis <- factor(df$crisis) %>% 
  mapvalues(
  c("1", "2", "3", "4"), 
  c("Significant", "Slight", "No Crisis", "Don't Know")
  )
#str(df, list.len = ncol(df))  #allows me to see the column types for all variables
#&prevents it from being truncated
