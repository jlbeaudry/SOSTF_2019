#CONVERT TO A FACTOR
#convert the crisis variable to a FACTOR (fct). 
#plus it changes the names of the levels
#df$crisis <- factor(df$crisis)
#str(df$crisis) #test to make sure it's reading it as a factor

# FIGURE OUT COLUMN NAMES & TYPES

#&prevents it from being truncated
#problems(df)
#pec(df) #shows me the column types, but for some reason this isn't working
#cols(df) gives me an error that I shouldn't get re "some 'col_types' are not 
#S3 collector objects: 1" --> there is some sort of problem with the list of 
#column names as far as I can tell, but this will be NEXT STEP!
