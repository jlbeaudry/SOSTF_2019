"43",1125,"Aware, But Not Used","I didn't like the set of options I was required to choose in the forced-choice question, as I agree that open data is ""important"" in principle, but is not generally possible in my sub-field due to some important restrictions.  There are a few reasons for this.  One, every dataset I work with is jointly owned with a community partner agency who provides me with data collected as part of their standard practice and who always places restriction on the confidentiality and sharing of that data.  We are not allowed to share the data with anyone.  Thus, to date, I have never been in a position where I could legally share ""my"" data on an open platform.  Two, there is good reason for this restriction as the data I use is sensitive in nature and there is strong reason to be highly cautious about the potential of reverse-identifying individuals, for example, if others might be able to find themselves or others in the dataset by selecting unique demographic information.  However, I think it should always be standard practice that if any qualified researcher wishes to re-run analyses on any of my datasets (e.g., to confirm that these analyses were done correctly), this should certainly be arranged.  This would require signing a Memorandum of Agreement to ensure that confidentiality of the dataset would be maintained and that the data would only be used for the purpose of confirming results, and would require the community agency to be aware of and approve this MOA as well. Although this is not ""open"" in the sense of the definition provided, I think this is an appropriate solution, given the importance of protecting sensitive information drawn about individuals (who may or may not have provided informed consent at the time of data collection, if there was a waiver of consent when creating the project and drawing the dataset from agency computer systems, and - relevant to any current dataset I work with - who certainly did not provide informed consent to have their data shared on an open platform)."
"44",1127,"Aware, But Not Used","Privacy. Happy to share upon request for individual researchers so I have more oversight on the issue"
"45",1128,"Aware, But Not Used","The kinds of data that I use would face considerable challenges in being made open due to the sensitive nature of the information. I would be worried that requiring open data would prevent ethics approvals given the potential for individuals to be identified using multiple data points. I also do not believe that our industry partners in security, police, correctional and health agencies would be supportive of providing data that was then open, as they require access and analysis via secure VPN even for us. I would also be concerned about the ethical elements of having data that was completely open given you could not warn participants in informed consent statements of the purposes of the data collection in a comprehensive way, as it could be used for unforeseen purposes."
