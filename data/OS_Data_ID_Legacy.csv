For example, when receiving a comprehensive dataset from a community partner (at which point it is often still unclear what exactly is in the dataset and what questions can be answered), should hypotheses be pre-registered then, or once clearer research questions have been determined (shortly prior to analysis)?  When conducting exploratory / explanatory research, it will always be easier to pre-register vague research questions at the initial stages of project development whereas more detailed descriptive research on the data (and more specific research questions) requires familiarity with the dataset.",,1,,,1,,,,,,1,1,3,,,,1,"Depending on the definition of ""open"", through personal connections, email requests, etc., I have widely shared materials I use (that are not copyrighted by others) upon request and used materials from others that were provided to me upon request.",,0,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,3,2,,,,,,,1,"I didn't like the set of options I was required to choose in the forced-choice question, as I agree that open data is ""important"" in principle, but is not generally possible in my sub-field due to some important restrictions.  There are a few reasons for this.  One, every dataset I work with is jointly owned with a community partner agency who provides me with data collected as part of their standard practice and who always places restriction on the confidentiality and sharing of that data.  We are not allowed to share the data with anyone.  Thus, to date, I have never been in a position where I could legally share ""my"" data on an open platform.  Two, there is good reason for this restriction as the data I use is sensitive in nature and there is strong reason to be highly cautious about the potential of reverse-identifying individuals, for example, if others might be able to find themselves or others in the dataset by selecting unique demographic information.  However, I think it should always be standard practice that if any qualified researcher wishes to re-run analyses on any of my datasets (e.g., to confirm that these analyses were done correctly), this should certainly be arranged.  This would require signing a Memorandum of Agreement to ensure that confidentiality of the dataset would be maintained and that the data would only be used for the purpose of confirming results, and would require the community agency to be aware of and approve this MOA as well. Although this is not ""open"" in the sense of the definition provided, I think this is an appropriate solution, given the importance of protecting sensitive information drawn about individuals (who may or may not have provided informed consent at the time of data collection, if there was a waiver of consent when creating the project and drawing the dataset from agency computer systems, and - relevant to any current dataset I work with - who certainly did not provide informed consent to have their data shared on an open platform). ",,,,,,,,1,,1,1,,1,1,3,2,,,,,,2,"I'm not sure it's a ""concern"" as much as a recognition that this practice (in my mind) requires a re-thinking about what role the broader scientific community should play in the development of the ""official"" scientific record.  Practices in science have generally been built around using appropriate peer review processes to ensure the work communicated to other experts and non-experts has been appropriately vetted and meets a minimum standard.  However, practices in science are also very human, evidencing all the strengths and flaws inherent within humanity.  If opening up work to the community for comment & refinement prior to going through an official peer review process helps refine the work so it is stronger at the time of peer review, sure, that seems nice.  Is this much different from what's already in place, i.e., official peer review, ranking of journals based on quality / prestige, committees to vet student research, supervisors to train student researchers, external markers to confirm dissertations are of minimum standard to award degrees?  These are all problematic in their own way, but a human attempt to improve science, whether perfect or not.  I guess I'm unsure what problems pre-publication are attempting to solve - problems with existing peer review?  People gaming the peer-review system?  People (rightfully, often) viewing the peer-review process as lacking in appropriate expertise, attention to detail, or other failures?  The file drawer effect?  The delay of communicating results until they've been properly vetted (with ""properly"" meaning flawed, of course)?  I'm not sure opening the publication process further than it already is is necessarily fixing these problems, and it is still a safeguard that only ""works"" to the degree that all individuals involved take seriously their responsibility to improve science, be experts in what they choose to comment on, behave ethically and without self-interest when reviewing others' work, be generous with their time providing this service to the community, and be honest with the general public when their work is actually valued by the scientific community and when it is not (i.e., not every paper that is formatted like a peer-reviewed publication is actually a peer-reviewed publication).   ",,,1,,,,,,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"It's possible for someone to conduct an identical study, but first they would need to build a relationship with the community agency, convince them to adopt new assessment protocols as standard practice in their system, and simultaneously build an agreement to share the data for analysis / feedback to the agency (as well as for peer-reviewed publishing).",,1,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,,1,Described in my responses above.,"Overall, our sub-field needs better leadership in this area, including guidance of how to adapt open science principles for the type of work we do.
